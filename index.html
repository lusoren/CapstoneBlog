        <p>In processing visuals, I’ve come to my first major decision… color or no color? The spirit of morse code
        is distilling something to its simplest components, and black and white feels it fits that bill. There’s
        also the binary aspect of morse code, dot or dash, tone or silence, black or white. I looked for typography
        driven, while still remaining communicative. <a href="http://parallelpractice.tumblr.com/page/2">Parallel Practice</a> did a poster series for an exhibition on
        Esperanto (num 4), which I found wildly inspiring.</p>

        <p>But then again… who doesn’t like some color. For a second approach I looked at projects using paper
        color as a simple signifier. For a kit of parts, I think color could play an essential part in breaking
        up the components visually, and also adding some fun.</p>

            <p>His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
            There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti</p>
            
            <p>It begins. After much deliberation, I decided to do something with my passion for dots and dashes. I
            plan to make a morse code learning kit, complete
            with telegraph key, study aids, and informational brochure. The driving question behind my capstone is how
            can I bring back morse code? It’s a bold question that demands bold action.</p>
            
            <p>After giving my proposal to the class, a few concerns to keep in mind...</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Why should someone take the time to learn morse code?</li>
                <li>How do I keep the user engaged in the process?</li>
                <li>Who is this for?</li>
            </ul>
